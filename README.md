Hi, I’m Roshan 👋

I build developer tools and like understanding how things work —
especially large codebases.

Currently working on:

- **[DevInsight](https://github.com/alcanivorax/devInsight)** — AI-powered GitHub repository analyzer
- **Nero** — a growing franchise of focused CLI tools

Tech I use:
TypeScript · Next.js · Node.js
